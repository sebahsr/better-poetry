 forgoten
 the rainbow and the mith
promise kept to never be broken 
words given to children 
they shall never die agin 
to keep them safe from themselves
rulles given with no consquence
isnt that so fiting we use it to piss daddy off
some say its just a story a mith like a unicorn 
a curse that never happend before
